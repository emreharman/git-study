We work and make some changes in working directory, Git realises the changes but does nothing at first. If we command git that "Yes, I've made these changes.", Git moves them to the staging area. You can assume this area as a buffer zone. Waiting room before create your new version or commit them to the local repo. Now if we command Git "Okay, I'm sure, let's commit it.", Git creates a new version of your project. Then you can push your project to a remote repository using GitHub or another platform. Also you can reach your project anywhere.

In addition, we can create a new branch and continue to build your project in this branch and then merge it with the main branch. Let's give an example to this: You have a project on production and you want to add a new feature. Also you don't want to break down your source code. At this point you can create a new branch and you can study new feature on this branch. Then you can merge it with your main branch when you're sure new feature works.

These are basic scenarios about using Git. We can increase examples. I tried to tell basic usage of Git.
