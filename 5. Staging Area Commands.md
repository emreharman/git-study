## Staging Area Command

- We've made changes and added them to staging area. Now talk about commands in staging area.

- We can move a file back to **untracked files** using `git rm --cached fileName`.

- Now we will commit files from the staging area to local repository. For this we use `git commit -m "our commit message"` command. Commit message should be meaningful for your versions understanding. Your commit has created.

- Let's talk about commit operations. You can list your commits with the `git log`. You can see your commits details as it's id, author, date and message. If you use `git log --oneline` command you will see your commits in a short form as it's id and message. I use this command usually to see them all together.

- I will add `git reset` and `git revert` commands later.

- Final command in this section is `git commit --amend -m "new message"`. This command changes our last commit's message. We can use different parameters with `--amend` parameter. I'll add examples as I learn.
