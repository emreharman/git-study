## Branches in Git

I will try to tell branches in this section.

- Git creates a branch named **master** default. If you want to change it's name use `git branch -M newBranchName` (it changes current branch's name. I assume that you have one branch).

- Let's create a new branch with `git branch yourBranchName` command. Now use `git branch -a` command to list your branches. You will see **master** in different color and your new branch. Different color means it's your current branch. All files copied to new branch.

- Let's switch to new branch using `git checkout yourBranchName` command. Now control branches with `git branch -a`. As you see your current branch has changed. Now make some changes in your new branch. For example you can add some new files or change some file's context. Then move it to staging area and commit. Now switch to your master branch (`git checkout master`).

- As you see your changes are not here. You can keep going with two branches and merge it to master branch any time you want. Let's merge it using `git merge yourBranchName` (be sure your current branch is master). I mean this command merges the branch that given as parameter with your current branch. Now you can see that your changes has came.

- Now you can switch between your branches, make changes and merge anytime you want.
