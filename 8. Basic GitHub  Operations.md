## Basic GitHub Operations

I will try to tell about what'is fork, pull request(PR) and merge. Let's look at this image:

- Think that you want to work with a friend and your friend started a project and pushed it to GitHub. If you want to make some changes on this project you should do these:

- First **fork** it from your friends repo. You will see that you have the same repo on your GitHub. Now create a folder and use `git clone theLinkYourFork`command. You cloned it to your local now. Make changes on it,commit and push it to your GitHub.

- Now check that your repo and your friends repo is different. If you want to send these changes to your friend, just click **Pull Request (PR)**. You can also add comment to your PR. Now there goes a claim to your friend. If your friend **merge**s it, your changes will be added his/her repo.
