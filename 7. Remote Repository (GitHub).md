## Remote Repository (GitHub)

Basicly we're ok with Git. We able to create our versions or working with different branches etc. Now let's talk about remote repository. I'll use GitHub.

- First create a GitHub account if you don't have one. Then open your account in your browser and click new repository. You will see this screen:
  ![create repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/create-new-repo.png)

Give it a name, write a description if you want, select private or public and check README if you want to add. Also you can add it later. If you select public everyone can see it else nobody can see it till you add someone as contributer or send an invite. Now click **Create Repository**. You will see a new screen includes a link. We will use this link for remote.

- Before we push our project to GitHub let's add a remote. You can think it's a short way. Use `git remote add origin yourGitHubRepoLink`. **origin** is modifiable, you can write anything but I usually use origin. **yourGitHubRepoLink** is the link that I said above. Now we can check if it exists using `git remote -v`.

- Now we can push our project to GitHub repo using `git push origin master`. **origin** is our remote. You can write the link also. **master** is the branch that we want to push.

- Now you can push your changes to your GitHub repo anytime you want. As a advice be sure `git status` is clean and no changes from the GitHub side.

- If you make some changes in GitHub repo you should use `git pull origin master` command to equalize your main project and GitHub repo.
