## About .gitignore

- If you want Git to ignore some files or folders in your project, use .gitignore. The file names, folder names or rules we write in it will be ignored by Git. It can be client infos, some database infos or etc.

- You should add files to .gitignore before commit. The best practise for using .gitignore is creating it at the begining of project. Let's do some example:

- Open your bash and write `touch .gitignore` command and create a any new file you want for ex `touch willignore.php`. Then open .gitignore file with an editor, write the file name you want to be ignored and save.

- Come back your dash and use `git status` command. As you see your file ignored by Git.
